				<p class="caption" id="captionSusanna">"It's a good idea to use an example for each of the verbs. It also helps much to have to write a sentence for each of the verbs and, also, the exercise of listening the audio and after writing what you've been listening. This is a complete exercise to learn a phrasal verb, his meaning, his sound, his use, his writing. I hope I can improve my English with this type of exercise."</p>
